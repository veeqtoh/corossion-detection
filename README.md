# corossion-detection
Welcome to Underwater Corossion Detection! In this project, I experimented with and compared the performance of two classifiers - A Non-neural classification (SVM) and a Neural network classification (MLP).
I reflected on their results and went on Improving the results from the better classifier with Tensorflow image augmentation.
I then went on to train a Neural network model to classify underwater images.
